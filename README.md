# PyBer Ride Share Analysis

**Overview of the Analysis**

**Background**

V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


**Results:**

The information of the data provided was used to create a table that displayed the differences between the city types to better understand the the fares and their outcomes

As it can be seen from this table above, it can be seen that there is a difference between all 3 types. 

- It seems that Rural is leading in the "Average Fare per Driver" and also "Average Fare per Ride". Presumably from the fact that there are more riders than drivers, so the demand is higher.
- On the other hand, Urban is the most lucrative out of the 3 for a few reason. One of them being that there are more drivers than riders and therefore making the demand lower as the supply of driver is abundant. This drives the "Average Fare per Ride" down as well as "Average Fare per Driver". 

The reason behind these occurrences is all driven by supply and demand.

And here is a visual representation of the difference between the types of of areas as well as how the fare difference compares with eachother. 

Again, it is clear that Urban makes more money than the rest due to the supply of drivers to the demand of riders. There is a significant difference between Urban and Rural with the middle ground being the Suburban areas. 



**Summary:**

Based on the results I would recommend a few things;

- Tackle the issue of supply and deman in both Rural and Suburban areas as there are more riders than drivers. This will increase the revenue as well as decrease the average fare as the supply and demand begins to balance out.
- Maintain the consitancy in the Urban areas as this is main provider of the company. 
- A vague recommendation for helping out these iniciatives would be to provide incentives to drivers in these areas to be able to increase the amount of drivers.
